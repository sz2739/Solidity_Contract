## Three Layers of Contracts 
We've generated three layers of contracts to serve three diferrent purposes here. 
1. Asoociate Profit Splitter
2. Tiered Profit Splitter 
3. Deferred Equity Plan

### Asoociate Profit Splitter
**Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.**
**Goal**: This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

### ATiered Profit Splitter 
**PDistribute profits to different tiers of employees.**
**Goal**: This will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

### Deferred Equity Plan
**Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.**
**Goal**: It models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.
